Econ 602: Course Project
The project is due on December 16th, 2024, by 11:59 pm. The   project asks you to   set   up   a   PowerPoint (PPT) file and an   Excel file: you should   upload   both   files   in   a   .zip   folder. .zip is the only compression format allowed: if you submit your assignment   using any other   compression   format your   grade   on   the   entire assignment will automatically be zero.
General Instructions: 
a)       This is an individual assignment. You should not consult others. 
b)       This   is an open   book   assignment. You   are   free   to   consult   any   source   but   all   sources   must   be acknowledged.    If you cut-and-paste   material without   mentioning the source,   you   will   lose   points.
Project 
Pick one of the following countries: Canada,   any   member   country   of   the   euro   area,   Japan,   or   the   United      Kingdom   (these are the   major trading   partners of the   US as far   as   advanced   economies   go).   You   should      turn   in a PPT and EXCEL file following the structure   given   below.   The   EXCEL   file   should   have   a   ‘read   me’   sheet explaining   how the file   is organized and what   it   contains.   Label   all   charts   clearly.   Each   axis   should    be clearly   labelled   mentioning what   is   showing and what the   units are   (e.g.   percent,   percentage change).    The “cosmetics” of your   PPT   presentation are   important and will   be   graded:   your   presentation   should   be of   professional quality.    Similarly, your   Excel file   should   be   set   up   in   a   way   that   is straightforward to   understand   by someone who   is   interested   in   reproducing your   results and asks you   to share your file: you will   be graded   on this   aspect   as   well   (to   this   end   the   ‘read   me’   file   is   critical,   but      also the way   in which your calculations are 代 写Econ 602: Course Project

For your chosen   country:
1) Present   some facts and pictures about   your   chosen   country   on slide 1 of   your   PPT.   (Also,   list   your name on   this   slide). 
2)       Show a chart of real GDP over time. Go   as   far   back   in   time   as   you   can   find   data.   This should   be slide 2 of the   PPT and the   data   should   be   in   the   EXCEL   file   . 
3)       Show a chart of real GDP per capita over time. Go   as   far   back   in   time   as   you   can   find   data. Slide 3 of the   PPT and   all the   data   should   be   in   the   EXCEL   file. 
4)       How would you describe the trends (or trends) in real income per capita? 
Slides 4 and 5. You can   use charts and   bullet   points to   describe   the   trends.   Any   computations   should   be given   in the   EXCEL file. All sources   must   be   listed   in the ‘notes’   part   of the   slide. 
5) How would you describe the business cycles or economic fluctuations (deviations from trend) in real income per capita? Deviations from trend (the cyclical component) should be calculated using the HP filter using the natural logarithm of data.

Slides 6 and 7. You can   use charts   and   bullet   points   to   describe   the   cycles. Any   computations   should   be given   in the   EXCEL file. All sources   must   be   listed   in the ‘notes’   part   of the   slide. 
6)       Estimate Okun’s Law and Phillips Curve for your chosen country. 
Slides 8 and 9.   Data   and   computations   must   be   in   the   EXCEL   file.
7)       ‘Wild card’ slides: The   content   of slides 10-15 is   up   to   you   to   decide. You   can   use   the   slides   to present facts or analysis about your chosen   country   that   are   related   to   our   course   material.
